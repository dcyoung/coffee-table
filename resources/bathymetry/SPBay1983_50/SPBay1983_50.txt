DATA SET:
NOAA-NOS 1983 Hydrographic survey of San Pablo Bay. 
The original point coverage includes 65,739 soundings.
Contours at 0, 6, 12, 18, 30, 36, and 60 feet.
The ArcInfo routine TOPOGRID was used to produce the grid.
The elevation grid (negative depth) was then converted to a 
Depth grid and rounded to the nearest centimeter.
